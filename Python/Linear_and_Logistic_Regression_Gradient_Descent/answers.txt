[exercise 2]
part 2
answer: Degree 4 model gives the best fit because it has the lowest MSE value 443.76


[exercise 3]
part 2
answer: Training set has 80% data. Test set has 20% data. I chose this division because the training set has to be
        large enough to be useful for creating a reliable model.

part 6
answer: Yes, they are the same. The qualitative results seem to follow a logical pattern. Those results are subject to
        change of based on the size of the training set. However, if the training set reaches a certain size,
        the effect of the increase of its size becomes minimum. Overall, the difference between two sets seemed normal.


[exercise 5]
part 2
answer: The difference is that this logistic regression uses stronger regularization. c=1 is the default value.
        It controls the importance of the regularization term. Smaller C increases regularization.

part 3
answer: As shown in the graph, at degree 1-2, regularized model has the same number of errors as non-regularized model.
        At degree 3-9, regularized model produces fewer errors. So regularized model performs best.


[exercise 6]
part 2
answer: the model with columns [4, 5, 2, 0] is the best one because it has comparatively low average absolute
        score (2.2463). Feature at column 4 is the most important one because it was selected first.
