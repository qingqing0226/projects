# BlackJack Game


#### _Qingqing Dai (qd222ab)_
#### The usage of the application:
The app runs and a player would see a menu of options. The player enters 'p' to play, the program would show messages letting the player know both the player and the dealer are receiving cards. Each card dealt has its respective message.
The player sees the value of the cards in their hand, and sees the cards which are allowed to be seen from the dealers hand.
then the player has to choose among the options again:
1. h for hit :The player is given an extra card
2. s for stand :The player is not given a card and the dealer chooses whether they want a card or not.
3. q for quit, The player exits the game.<br />

The game is finished when either both the players have passed 21 in score
or both players choose to stand, then the one closest to 21 wins.
In the case of a draw there are two implementations of the game that can be chosen. Either the players wins in the case of a draw or the dealer.
In addition, in each implementation, if both are above 21, then the same win advantage will apply and either the player or the dealer would win depending on which strategy has been set.
